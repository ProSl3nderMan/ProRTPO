# ProRTPO
A remake of RTPO that does what /rtpo does, but instead does not randomly tp you to players you've already randomly tped to. Once you reach the end of the list of people you haven't randomly tped to, the list will reset and you cycle through all the online players again. The command now is /prtpo, and you can do /prtpo clear to clear your list of people you've already randomly tped to.

# Building
If you want to build ProRTPO yourself, you will need Maven and JDK 8.

    1. Clone the ProRTPO project: git clone https://github.com/ProSl3nderMan/ProRTPO.git

    2. Run mvn clean install

Then boom, you'll have yourself a ProRTPO.jar, should be located under the target directory.
